rake-backup is, at present, a quick and dirty set of rake tasks for backing up
numerous server stuff: filesystems, databases, package manifests. Its
operational goals are to provide a daily backup system for our office network -
a bunch of physical Mac/Linux boxes and 10 or so virtual servers.

So far, we've got rudimentary support for:
 * MySQL
 * List of installed Debian packages
 * Filesystem backups via duplicity

The near future will see the addition of XFS dumping and PostgreSQL adapters,
backup verification and Amazon S3 support.

This is pre-alpha software; expect a gem release when we're fit for human
consumption.

Contributions heartily appreciated.

Quick usage example:

(in Rakefile)

require 'lib/rake-backup'

backup_mysql :username => "root", :gzip => true, :to => "/home/backup/mysql.gz"
backup_dpkg :to => "/home/backup/installed_packages"

jason@oreo # rake backup_all
